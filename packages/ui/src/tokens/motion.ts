/**
 * Motion tokens — durations and translate distances.
 *
 * Durations are in milliseconds. Must match animations.css and
 * apps/omiro/theme/motion.ts (which imports from here).
 *
 * CSS easing strings are web-only. Mobile uses react-native-reanimated
 * Easing.* functions which cannot be expressed as strings — the mobile
 * motion.ts keeps those local and imports only the numeric constants here.
 *
 * ## Animation mandate
 *
 * Web interactive animations MUST use the shared GSAP helpers exposed by the
 * consuming app.
 * The canonical sequences (playFocusExpand, playFocusCollapse,
 * playContextSwitch, playSubmitPulse, playEnterRow, playExitRow,
 * playShimmer) read the numeric constants from this file so all motion
 * stays in sync.
 *
 * CSS `void-anim-*` classes (animations.css) are reserved for Radix UI
 * component enter/exit only — do not add new CSS keyframe animations for
 * interactive product surfaces.
